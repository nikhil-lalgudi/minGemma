OpenWebText is a large-scale dataset that consists of web pages collected from the internet. It serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating language models. The dataset contains a diverse range of topics and writing styles, making it suitable for various natural language processing tasks.

One of the main reasons OpenWebText is used is because it is the primary dataset used to train GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. GPT is a state-of-the-art language model that has achieved impressive results in various language-related tasks. By training models on OpenWebText, researchers and developers can improve the performance and capabilities of GPT and other similar models.

The purpose of using OpenWebText is s that the MinGemma model can be compared to Andrej Karpathy's NanoGPT model, thus allowing a reader compare efficiency.
